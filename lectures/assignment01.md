Here's a step-by-step guide to get started with MetaMask and Etherscan:
 
1.  Install MetaMask browser extension on Google Chrome, Firefox, or Brave.
   
2.  Create a new MetaMask wallet by following the on-screen instructions.
   
3.  Backup the seed phrase to access your wallet in the future.
   
4.  Fund your MetaMask wallet with Ether (ETH) from a cryptocurrency exchange or another wallet. For this example we will be interacting with the Goerli Test Network for Ethereum. You can use this faucet, https://goerlifaucet.com/, to access the test ETH to interact with the contract
   
5.  Go to Etherscan.io, a blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network, and search for the smart contract you want to interact with. For our example we will use the following contract address: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x40203b6d16152D290750C3ABc40bD575ddaCda8D
   
6.  Open the smart contract's page and look for the "Contract" tab.
   
7.  Connect your MetaMask wallet to the smart contract by clicking on the "Connect to Contract" button.
   
8.  Look at the functions offered under the Read Contract tab and Write Contract tab.
   
9.  Verify the details of the smart contract, such as its functions and variables, and interact with it by calling its functions.
   
10.  Confirm the transaction on MetaMask by clicking on the "Sign" button, and then wait for it to be mined on the Ethereum network.
   
11.  Verify the transaction on Etherscan to see the updated state of the smart contract.
   
That's it! With MetaMask and Etherscan, you can now interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
