# Lecture 4 -- Project Overview and Design

## Introduction

Crowdfunding has a rich history, dating back to the Free Software initiative of the late 1980s and early 1990s. This movement sought to promote the sharing and collaboration of software code, with the goal of making software accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial means. In 1997, the Free and Open Source [(FOSS)](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) software project, (VIM)(https://medium.com/@jovica/the-history-of-vim-b707758fb54f), adopted a charitable funding approach, which allowed users to donate money to support the development of the software. This was one of the earliest examples of crowdfunding in practice.

As the internet and technology advanced, crowdfunding evolved and expanded. In the early 2000s, platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo emerged, allowing artists, entrepreneurs, and innovators to raise funds for creative projects. These platforms revolutionized the way people could raise money, and they opened up new opportunities for people to bring their ideas to life.

In recent years, the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies has created new possibilities for crowdfunding. With decentralized exchanges, it is now possible to raise funds for projects through initial coin offerings (ICOs) or security token offerings (STOs). These decentralized offerings offer investors a new way to invest in projects, and they provide entrepreneurs with a way to raise funds without relying on traditional financing methods.

In conclusion, crowdfunding has come a long way since its beginnings in the Free Software initiative. Today, there are a multitude of options for people looking to raise funds, from traditional crowdfunding platforms to decentralized offerings in the crypto world. The evolution of crowdfunding has opened up new opportunities for people to bring their ideas to life, and it continues to be a dynamic and rapidly growing field.

## History

Cryptocurrency and open source software funding have similar roots in that they both rely on decentralized communities and rely on contributions from individuals to sustain and grow their projects. However, there are some key differences between the two that are worth exploring.

Open source software funding traditionally comes from a variety of sources, including corporate sponsors, individual donations, and grants from foundations. This funding is usually used to support ongoing development, hosting, and infrastructure costs. Some successful open source projects, such as the Linux operating system, have attracted significant corporate backing and have grown into mature, well-established projects.

In contrast, cryptocurrency funding is often obtained through initial coin offerings (ICOs), which are similar to initial public offerings (IPOs) in the stock market. An ICO is a way for a new cryptocurrency project to raise funds by issuing and selling new tokens to investors. These tokens can then be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges and can appreciate in value if the project is successful.

Another difference is that open source software funding is often more transparent and accountable, with clear processes for how funds are used and how decisions are made. In the world of cryptocurrencies, there is often less transparency and accountability, with some projects being accused of misusing funds or making decisions that benefit a small group of insiders.

While cryptocurrency and open source funding share some similarities, they also have key differences in terms of how funding is obtained, the motivations of contributors, and the transparency and accountability of the projects themselves.
